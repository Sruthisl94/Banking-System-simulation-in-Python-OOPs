# Banking-System-simulation-in-Python-OOPs
This is a simple Python program that simulates a basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to:

## Login using an account PIN.
## Deposit money into their account.
## Withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.
## Check their current balance.
## View transaction history (deposits and withdrawals).
Features:

Amount Withdrawal: Allows withdrawing money from the account with sufficient balance checks.
Transaction History: Displays a record of all transactions (deposits and withdrawals).

Code Structure:
The program is implemented using a BankAccount class that encapsulates all functionalities such as login, deposit, withdrawal, transaction history, and balance checking.

Class: BankAccount
Attributes:

account_number: The unique account number of the user.
pin: The PIN for login validation.
